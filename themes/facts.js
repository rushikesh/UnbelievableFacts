The astronomer Fred Hoyle said they came from space.","Oxygen is circulated around the helmet in space suits in order to prevent the visor from misting.","The middle layers of space suits are blown up like a balloon to press against the astronaut's body. Without this pressure, the astronaut's body would boil!","The gloves included in the space suit have silicon rubber fingertips which allow the astronaut some sense of touch.","The full cost of a spacesuit is about $11 million although 70% of this is for the backpack and the control module.","Ever wondered how the pull of gravity is calculated between heavenly bodies? It's simple. Just multiply their masses together, and then divide the total by the square of the distance between them.","Glowing nebulae are named so because they give off a dim, red light, as the hydrogen gas in them is heated by radiation from the nearby stars.","The Drake Equation was proposed by astronomer Frank Drake to work out how many civilizations there could be in our galaxy - and the figure is in millions.","SETI is the Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence - the program that analyzes radio signals from space for signs of intelligent life.","The Milky Way galaxy we live in: is one among the BILLIONS in space.","The Milky Way galaxy is whirling rapidly, spinning our sun and all its other stars at around 100 million km per hour.","The Sun travels around the galaxy once every 200 million years – a journey of 100,000 light years.","There may be a huge black hole in the very middle of the most of the galaxies.","The Universe is probably about 15 billion years old, but the estimations vary.","One problem with working out the age of the Universe is that there are stars in our galaxy which are thought to be 14 to 18 billion years old – older than the estimated age of the Universe. So, either the stars must be younger, or the Universe older.","The very furthest galaxies are spreading away from us at more than 90% of the speed of light.","The Universe was once thought to be everything that could ever exist, but recent theories about inflation (e.g. Big Bang) suggest our universe may be just one of countless bubbles of space time.","The Universe may have neither a centre nor an edge, because according to Einstein’s theory of relativity, gravity bends all of space time around into an endless curve.","If you fell into a black hole, you would stretch like spaghetti.","Matter spiraling into a black hole is torn apart and glows so brightly that it creates the brightest objects in the Universe – quasars.","The swirling gases around a black hole turn it into an electrical generator, making it spout jets of electricity billions of kilometers out into space.","The opposite of black holes are estimated to be white holes which spray out matter and light like fountains.","A day in Mercury lasts approximately as long as 59 days on earth. Twice during Mercury’s orbit, it gets so close to the Sun and speeds so much that the Sun seems to go backwards in the sky.","Nicolaus Copernicus was the astronomer who first suggested that the Sun was the centre, and that the Earth went round the sun.","The ideas of Copernicus came not from looking at the night sky, but from studying ancient astronomy.","As the earth turns, the stars come back to the same place in the night sky every 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.09 seconds.

Most satellites fly in low orbits, 300 km from the earth.","Hipparchus was the first astronomer to try to work out how far away the Sun is.","The red color of Mars is due to oxidized (rusted) iron in its soil.","Mars’s volcano Olympus Mons is the biggest in the solar system. It covers the same area as Ireland and is three times higher than our Mount Everest.","Planets have magnetic field around them because of the liquid iron in their cores. As the planets rotate, so the iron swirls, generating electric currents that create the magnetic field.","Earth’s atmosphere is the only atmosphere discovered till date that human can breathe in.","Earth’s atmosphere was formed from gases pouring out from volcanoes.","Jupiter has no surface for a spacecraft to land on because it is made mostly from helium gas and hydrogen. The massive pull of Jupiter’s gravity squeezes the hydrogen so hard that it is liquid.","Jupiter spins right round in less than 10 hours which means that the planet’s surface is moving at nearly 50,000 km/hr.","The first successful planetary space probe was the USA’s Mariner 2, which flew past Venus in 1962.","Voyager 2 has flown over 6 billion km and is heading out of the solar system after passing close to Neptune in 1989.","To save fuel on journeys to distant planets, space probes may use a nearby planet’s gravity to catapult them on their way. This is called slingshot.","Hubble’s law showed that Universe is getting bigger – and so must have started very small. This led to the idea of Big Bang.","It’s believed that it was the impact of a big meteorite may have chilled the earth and wiped out all the dinosaurs.","The first astronomers thought the regular pulses from far space might be signals from aliens, and pulsars were jokingly called LGMs (short for Little Green Men).","Pulsars probably result from a supernova explosion - that is why most are found in the flat disc of the Milky Way, where supernovae occur.","Three moons have yet been found to have their own moons: Saturn’s moon Titan, Jupiter’s Lo, and Neptune’s Triton.","The largest moon in the Solar System is the Jupiter’s moon Ganymede.","Saturn is not solid, but is made almost entirely of gas – mostly liquid hydrogen and helium. Only in the planet’s very small core is there any rock.","Winds ten times stronger than a hurricane on Earth swirl around Saturn’s equator reaching up to 1100 km/h – and they never let up: even for a moment.","The first space station was the Soviet Salyut 1 launched in April 1971; its low orbit meant it stayed up only five months.","In April 2001, Dennis Tito became the first space tourist, ferried up to the ISS by the Russian Soyuz space shuttle.","Einstein’s theory of general relativity shows that gravity not only pulls on matter, but also space and even ‘Time’ itself.","Since the star Deneb is 1800 light years away, we see it as it was when the emperor Septimus Severius was ruling the Rome (AD 200).","With powerful telescopes, astronomers can see galaxies 2 billion light years away. This means we see them as they were when the only life forms in Earth were bacteria.","The slowest rotating planet is Venus, which takes 243.01 days to turn around.","The fastest spinning objects in the Universe are neutron stars – these can rotate 500 times in just 1 second.","In summer in Uranus, the sun does not set for 20 years. In winter, darkness lasts for 20 years. In autumn, the sun rises and sets every 9 hours.","Uranus’s moon Miranda is the weirdest moon of all. It seems to have been blasted apart, and then put together again.","Solar flares reach temperatures of 10 million °C and have the energy of a million atom bombs.","True binary stars are two stars held together by one another’s gravity, which spend their lives whirling around together like a pair of dancers.","Halley predicted that a comet he had discovered would return in 1758, 16 years after his death, and it really did. It was the first time a comet’s arrival had been predicted, and the comet was named after him as Halley’s Comet.","Ceres is the biggest asteroid in the Solar System – 940 km across, and 0.0002% the size of the earth.","The sun is about 5 billion years old and half a way through its life – as a medium sized star it will probably live for around 10 billion years.","Neptune’s mood Triton is the coldest place in the Solar System, with surface temperatures of -236°C.","Voyager 2 will beam back data until 2020 as it travels beyond the edges of the Solar System.","The Pioneer 10 and 11 probes carry metal plaques with messages for aliens telling them about us.","Einstein’s theory of Special Relativity (1905) shows that all measurements are relative, including time and speed. In other words, time and speed depends upon where you measure them.","When things are falling, their acceleration cancels out gravity, which is why astronauts in orbits are weightless.","The first space telescope was the Copernicus, sent out in 1972.","Astronauts learn Scuba diving which helps them to deal with space walks.","Weightlessness makes astronauts grow several centimeters during a long mission.","The first living creature in space was the dog Laika on – board Sputnik 2 in 1957. Sadly, she died when the spacecraft’s oxygen supply ran out.","The first manned space flight was made in April 1961 by the Soviet Cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin in Vostok 1.","The heart of a star reaches 16 million °C. A grain of sand this hot would kill someone 150 km away.","Stars twinkle because we see them through the wafting of the atmosphere.","The sun weighs 2,000 trillion trillion tones – about 300,000 times as much as the Earth – even though it is made almost entirely of hydrogen and helium, the lightest gases in the Universe.","The sun gets hot because it is so big that the pressure in its core is so tremendous – enough to force the nuclei of hydrogen atoms to fuse to make helium atoms. This nuclear reaction is like a gigantic atom bomb and it releases huge amounts of heat.","The nuclear fusion reactions in the Sun’s core send out billions of light photons every minute but they take 10 million years to reach its surface.","The Hiroshima bombs released 84 trillion joules of energy. A supernova releases 125,000 trillion trillion times as such.","The most distant galaxies (quasars) have red shifts so big that they must be moving away from us at speeds approaching the speed of light.","When light waves from distant galaxies are stretched out his way, they look redder. This is called red shift.","The moon’s gravity is 17% of the Earth’s so astronauts in space suits can jump 4 m high on the moon.","The moon is the only other world that humans have set foot on. Because the moon has no atmosphere or wind, the footprints planted in its dusty surface in 1969 by the Apollo astronauts are still there today, perfectly preserved.","On the moon’s surface are large dark patches called seas – because this is what people once believed they were. They are, in fact, lava flows from ancient volcanoes.","Quasars are the most distant known objects in the Universe. Even the nearest is billions of light years away.","The brightest quasar is 3C 273, 2 billion light years away.","The brightest stars in the night sky are not actually stars, but the planets Jupiter, Venus, Mars and Mercury.","Jupiter’s moon Europa may have oceans of water beneath its dry surface and it is a major target in the search for life in the Solar System.","There may be 20 trillion galaxies in the Universe.","Galaxies are often found in a group or clusters. One cluster may have 30 or so galaxies in it.","In the 1970s the US Vikings 1 and 2 and the Soviet Mars 3 and 5 probes all reached the surface of Mars.","The Solar System has nine planets including Pluto, but Pluto may be an escaped moon or an asteroid not a planet.","The Milky Way belongs to a cluster of 30 galaxies called the Local Group, which is 7 million light years across.","The Virgo Cluster is 50 million light years away and is made up of 1000 galaxies.","For a satellite or a spacecraft to stay in orbit 200 km above the earth, it has to fly over 8 km/sec.","When a spacecraft reaches 140% of the orbital velocity i.e. 11.2 km/sec, it is going fast enough to break free of the Earth’s gravity. This is called escape velocity.","Saturn’s rings are sets of thin rings of ice, dust and tiny rocks, which orbit the planet around its equator.","A tablespoon of neutron star would weigh about ten billion tones.","The earth actually takes 365.24219 days to orbit the Sun, which is called one Solar Year. To compensate for the missing 0.242 days, the western calendar adds an extra day in February every fourth (leap) year, but misses out three leap years every four centuries.","X-Rays cannot reach the earth’s atmosphere, so astronomers can only detect them using space telescopes such as ROSAT.","The Sun has sunspots, the dark spots on the Sun’s photosphere (surface), 2000°C cooler than the rest of the surface.","After the big bang, there was antimatter, the mirror image of matter. Antimatter and matter destroyed each other when they met, thus they annihilated. Matter just won, but the Universe was left almost empty.","The afterglow of the Big Bang can still be detected as microwave background radiation coming from all over space.","Dishes in the space telescopes have to be made accurate two billionths of a millimeter.","You can see another galaxy with the naked eye: the Andromeda Galaxy, 2.2 million light years away.","Dried up riverbeds show that Mars probably once had water in its surface. There is sometimes ice at the poles and maybe water underground.","For a satellite to fly off into the space, its momentum should be greater than the pull of gravity of the earth.","The future of the Universe may depend on how much dark matter there is. If there is too much, its gravity will eventually stop the Universe’s expansion – and make it shrink again."];

var HumanBody = ["<em>Nerve impulses to and from the brain travel as fast as 170 miles per hour. </em>Ever wonder how you can react so fast to things around you or why that stubbed toe hurts right away? It’s due to the super-speedy movement of nerve impulses from your brain to the rest of your body and vice versa, bringing reactions at the speed of a high powered luxury sports car.","<em>The brain operates on the same amount of power as 10-watt light bulb. </em>The cartoon image of a light bulb over your head when a great thought occurs isn’t too far off the mark. Your brain generates as much energy as a small light bulb even when you’re sleeping.","<em>The human brain cell can hold 5 times as much information as the Encyclopedia Britannica.</em> Or any other encyclopedia for that matter. Scientists have yet to settle on a definitive amount, but the storage capacity of the brain in electronic terms is thought to be between 3 or even 1,000 terabytes. The National Archives of Britain, containing over 900 years of history, only takes up 70 terabytes, making your brain’s memory power pretty darn impressive.","<em>Your brain uses 20% of the oxygen that enters your bloodstream. </em>The brain only makes up about 2% of our body mass, yet consumes more oxygen than any other organ in the body, making it extremely susceptible to damage related to oxygen deprivation. So breathe deep to keep your brain happy and swimming in oxygenated cells.","<em>The brain is much more active at night than during the day. </em>Logically, you would think that all the moving around, complicated calculations and tasks and general interaction we do on a daily basis during our working hours would take a lot more brain power than, say, lying in bed. Turns out, the opposite is true. When you turn off your brain turns on. Scientists don’t yet know why this is but you can thank the hard work of your brain while you sleep for all those pleasant dreams.","<em>Scientists say the higher your I.Q. the more you dream. </em>While this may be true, don’t take it as a sign you’re mentally lacking if you can’t recall your dreams. Most of us don’t remember many of our dreams and the average length of most dreams is only 2-3 seconds–barely long enough to register.","<em>Neurons continue to grow throughout human life. </em>For years scientists and doctors thought that brain and neural tissue couldn’t grow or regenerate. While it doesn’t act in the same manner as tissues in many other parts of the body, neurons can and do grow throughout your life, adding a whole new dimension to the study of the brain and the illnesses that affect it.","<em>Information travels at different speeds within different types of neurons. </em>Not all neurons are the same. There are a few different types within the body and transmission along these different kinds can be as slow as 0.5 meters/sec or as fast as 120 meters/sec.","<em>The brain itself cannot feel pain. </em>While the brain might be the pain center when you cut your finger or burn yourself, the brain itself does not have pain receptors and cannot feel pain. That doesn’t mean your head can’t hurt. The brain is surrounded by loads of tissues, nerves and blood vessels that are plenty receptive to pain and can give you a pounding","<em>80% of the brain is water. </em>Your brain isn’t the firm, gray mass you’ve seen on TV. Living brain tissue is a squishy, pink and jelly-like organ thanks to the loads of blood and high water content of the tissue. So the next time you’re feeling dehydrated get a drink to keep your brain hydrated.","<em>Facial hair grows faster than any other hair on the body. </em>If you’ve ever had a covering of stubble on your face as you’re clocking out at 5 o’clock you’re probably pretty familiar with this. In fact, if the average man never shaved his  it would grow to over 30 feet during his lifetime, longer than a killer whale.","<em>Every day the average person loses 60-100 strands of hair. </em>Unless you’re already bald, chances are good that you’re shedding pretty heavily on a daily basis. Your hair loss will vary in accordance with the season, pregnancy, illness, diet and age.","<em>Women’s hair is about half the diameter of men’s hair. </em>While it might sound strange, it shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise that men’s hair should be coarser than that of women. Hair diameter also varies on average between races, making hair plugs on some men look especially obvious.","<em>One human hair can support 3.5 ounces. </em>That’s about the weight of two full size candy bars, and with hundreds of thousands of hairs on the human head, makes the tale of  much more plausible.","<em>The fastest growing nail is on the middle finger. </em>And the nail on the middle finger of your dominant hand will grow the fastest of all. Why is not entirely known, but nail growth is related to the length of the finger, with the longest fingers growing nails the fastest and shortest the slowest.","<em>There are as many hairs per square inch on your body as a chimpanzee. </em>Humans are not quite the naked apes that we’re made out to be. We have lots of hair, but on most of us it’s not obvious as a majority of the hairs are too fine or light to be seen.","<em>Blondes have more hair.</em> They’re said to have more fun, and they definitely have more hair. Hair color determines how dense the hair on your head is. The average human has 100,000 hair follicles, each of which is capable of producing 20 individual hairs during a person’s lifetime. Blondes average 146,000 follicles while people with black hair tend to have about 110,000 follicles. Those with brown hair fit the average with 100,000 follicles and redheads have the least dense hair, with about 86,000 follicles.","<em>Fingernails grow nearly 4 times faster than toenails.</em> If you notice that you’re trimming your fingernails much more frequently than your toenails you’re not just imagining it. The nails that get the most exposure and are used most frequently grow the fastest. On average, nails on both the toes and fingers grow about one-tenth of an inch each month.","<em>The lifespan of a human hair is 3 to 7 years on average. </em>While you quite a few hairs each day, your hairs actually have a pretty long life providing they aren’t subject to any trauma. Your hairs will likely get to see several different haircuts, styles, and even possibly decades before they fall out on their own.","<em>You must lose over 50% of your scalp hairs before it is apparent to anyone. </em>You lose hundreds of hairs a day but you’ll have to lose a lot more before you or anyone else will notice. Half of the hairs on your pretty little head will have to disappear before your impending baldness will become obvious to all those around you.","<em>Human hair is virtually indestructible.</em> Aside from it’s flammability, human hair decays at such a slow rate that it is practically non-disintegrative. If you’ve ever wondered how your how clogs up your pipes so quick consider this: hair cannot be destroyed by cold, change of climate, water, or other natural forces and it is resistant to many kinds of acids and corrosive chemicals.","<em>The largest internal organ is the small intestine.</em> Despite being called the smaller of the two intestines, your small intestine is actually four times as long as the average adult is tall. If it weren’t looped back and forth upon itself it wouldn’t fit inside the abdominal cavity.","<em>The human heart creates enough pressure to squirt blood 30 feet. </em>No wonder you can feel your heartbeat so easily. Pumping blood through your body quickly and efficiently takes quite a bit of pressure resulting in the strong contractions of the heart and the thick walls of the ventricles which push blood to the body.","<em>The acid in your stomach is strong enough to dissolve razorblades. </em>While you certainly shouldn’t test the fortitude of your stomach by eating a razorblade or any other metal object for that matter, the  that digest the food you eat aren’t to be taken lightly. Hydrochloric acid, the type found in your stomach, is not only good at dissolving the pizza you had for dinner but can also eat through many types of metal.","<em>The human body is estimated to have 60,000 miles of blood vessels. </em>To put that in perspective, the distance around the earth is about 25,000 miles, making the distance your blood vessels could travel if laid end to end more than two times around the earth.","<em>You get a new stomach lining every three to four days.</em> The mucus-like cells lining the walls of the stomach would soon dissolve due to the strong digestive acids in your stomach if they weren’t constantly replaced. Those with ulcers know how painful it can be when stomach acid takes its toll on the lining of your stomach.","<em>The surface area of a human lung is equal to a tennis court. </em>In order to more efficiently oxygenate the blood, the lungs are filled with thousands of branching bronchi and tiny, grape-like  These are filled with microscopic capillaries which oxygen and carbon dioxide. The large amount of surface area makes it easier for this exchange to take place, and makes sure you stay properly oxygenated at all times.","<em>Women’s hearts beat faster than men’s.</em>The main reason for this is simply that on average women tend to be smaller than men and have less mass to pump blood to. But women’s and men’s hearts can actually act quite differently, especially when experiencing trauma like a heart attack, and many treatments that work for men must be adjusted or changed entirely to work for women.","<em>Scientists have counted over 500 different liver functions. </em>You may not think much about your liver except after a long night of drinking, but the liver is one of the body’s hardest working, largest and busiest organs. Some of the functions your liver performs are: production of bile, decomposition of red blood cells, plasma protein synthesis, and detoxification.","<em>The aorta is nearly the diameter of a garden hose.</em> The average adult heart is about the size of two fists, making the size of the aorta quite impressive. The artery needs to be so large as it is the main supplier of rich, oxygenated blood to the rest of the body.","<em>Your left lung is smaller than your right lung to make room for your heart. </em>For most people, if they were asked to draw a picture of what the lungs look like they would draw both looking roughly the same size. While the lungs are fairly similar in size, the human heart, though located fairly centrally, is tilted slightly to the left making it take up more room on that side of the body and crowding out that poor left lung.","<em>You could remove a large part of your internal organs and survive.</em> The human body may appear fragile but it’s possible to survive even with the removal of the stomach, the spleen, 75 percent of the liver, 80 percent of the intestines, one kidney, one lung, and virtually every organ from the pelvic and groin area. You might not feel too great, but the missing organs wouldn’t kill you.","<em>The adrenal glands change size throughout life.</em> The adrenal glands, lying right above the kidneys, are responsible for releasing stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. In the seventh month of a fetus’ development, the glands are roughly the same size as the kidneys. At birth, the glands have shrunk slightly and will continue to do so throughout life. In fact, by the time a person reaches old age, the glands are so small they can hardly be seen.","<em>Sneezes regularly exceed 100 mph. </em>There’s a good reason why you can’t keep your eyes open when you sneeze–that sneeze is rocketing out of your body at close to 100 mph. This is, of course, a good reason to cover your mouth when you sneeze.","<em>Coughs clock in at about 60 mph. </em>Viruses and colds get spread around the office and the classroom quickly during cold and flu season. With 60 mph coughs spraying germs far and wide, it’s no wonder.","<em>Women blink twice as many times as men do. </em>That’s a lot of blinking every day. The average person, man or woman, blinks about 13 times a minute.","<em>A full bladder is roughly the size of a soft ball. </em>No wonder you have to run to bathroom when you feel the call of the wild. The average bladder holds about 400-800 cc of fluid but most people will feel the urge to go long before that at 250 to 300 cc.","<em>Approximately 75% of human waste is made of water. </em>While we might typically think that urine is the liquid part of human waste products, the truth is that what we consider solid waste is actually mostly water as well. You should be thankful that most waste is fairly water-filled, as drier harder stools are what cause constipation and are much harder and sometimes painful to pass.","<em>Feet have 500,000 sweat glands and can produce more than a pint of sweat a day. </em>With that kind of sweat-producing power it’s no wonder that your gym shoes have a stench that can peel paint. Additionally, men usually have much more active sweat glands than women.","<em>During your lifetime, you will produce enough saliva to fill two swimming pools. </em>Saliva plays an important part in beginning the digestive process and keeping the mouth lubricated, and your mouth produces quite a bit of it on a daily basis.","<em>The average person expels flatulence 14 times each day. </em>Even if you’d like to think you’re too dignified to pass gas, the reality is that almost everyone will at least a few times a day. Digestion causes the body to release gases which can be painful if trapped in the abdomen and not released.","<em>Earwax production is necessary for good ear health. </em>While many people find earwax to be disgusting, it’s actually a very important part of your ear’s defense system. It protects the delicate inner ear from bacteria, fungus, dirt and even insects. It also cleans and lubricates the ear canal.","<em>On any given day, sexual intercourse takes place 120 million times on earth. </em>Humans are a quickly proliferating species, and with about 4% of the world’s population having sex on any given day, it’s no wonder that birth rates continue to increase in many places all over the world.","<em>The largest cell in the human body is the female egg and the smallest is the male sperm. </em>While you can’t see skin cells or muscle cells, the ovum is typically large enough to be seen with the naked eye with a diameter of about a millimeter. The sperm cell, on the other hand, is tiny, consisting of little more than nucleus.","<em>The three things pregnant women dream most of during their first trimester are frogs, worms and potted plants. </em>Pregnancy hormones can cause mood swings, cravings and many other unexpected changes. Oddly enough, hormones can often affect the types of dreams women have and their vividness. The most common are these three types, but many women also dream of water, giving birth or even have violent or sexually charged dreams.","<em>Your teeth start growing 6 months before you are born. </em>While few babies are born with teeth in place, the teeth that will eventually push through the gums of young children are formed long before the child even leaves the womb. At 9 to 12 weeks the fetus starts to form the teeth buds that will turn into baby teeth.","<em>Babies are always born with blue eyes. </em>The color of your eyes depends on the genes you get from your parents, but at birth most babies appear to have blue eyes. The reason behind this is the pigment melanin. The melanin in a newborn’s eyes often needs time after birth to be fully deposited or to be darkened by exposure to ultraviolet light, later revealing the baby’s true eye color.","<em>Babies are, pound for pound, stronger than an ox. </em>While a baby certainly couldn’t pull a covered wagon at its present size, if the child were the size of an oxen it just might very well be able to. Babies have especially strong and powerful legs for such tiny creatures, so watch out for those kicks.","<em>One out of every 2,000 newborn infants has a tooth when they are born. </em>Nursing mothers may cringe at this fact. Sometimes the tooth is a regular baby tooth that has already erupted and sometimes it is an extra tooth that will fall out before the other set of choppers comes in.","<em>A fetus acquires fingerprints at the age of three months. </em>When only a small fraction of the way through its development, a fetus will have already developed one of the most unique human traits: fingerprints. At only 6-13 weeks of development, the whorls of what will be fingerprints have already developed. Oddly enough, those fingerprints will not change throughout the person’s life and will be one of the last things to disappear after death.","<em>Every human spent about half an hour as a single cell. </em>All life has to begin somewhere, and even the largest humans spent a short part of their lives as a single celled organism when sperm and egg cells first combine. Shortly afterward, the cells begin rapidly dividing and begin forming the components of a tiny embryo.","<em>Most men have erections every hour to hour and a half during sleep. </em>Most people’s bodies and minds are much more active when they’re sleeping than they think. The combination of blood circulation and testosterone production can cause erections during sleep and they’re often a normal and necessary part of REM sleep.","<em>After eating too much, your hearing is less sharp. </em>If you’re heading to a concert or a musical after a big meal you may be doing yourself a disservice. Try eating a smaller meal if you need to keep your hearing pitch perfect.","<em>About one third of the human race has 20-20 vision. </em>Glasses and contact wearers are hardly alone in a world where two thirds of the population have less than perfect vision. The amount of people with perfect vision decreases further as they age.","<em>If saliva cannot dissolve something, you cannot taste it. </em>In order for foods, or anything else, to have a taste, chemicals from the substance must be dissolved by saliva. If you don’t believe it, try drying off your tongue before tasting something.","<em>Women are born better smellers than men and remain better smellers over life. </em> have shown that women are more able to correctly pinpoint just what a smell is. Women were better able to identify citrus, vanilla, cinnamon and coffee smells. While women are overall better smellers, there is an unfortunate 2% of the population with no sense of smell at all.","<em>Your nose can remember 50,000 different scents. </em>While a bloodhound’s nose may be a million times more sensitive than a human’s, that doesn’t mean that the human sense of smell is useless. Humans can identify a wide variety of scents and many are strongly tied to memories.","<em>Even small noises cause the pupils of the eyes to dilate.</em> It is believed that this is why surgeons, watchmakers and others who perform delicate manual operations are so bothered by uninvited noise. The sound causes their pupils to change focus and blur their vision, making it harder to do their job well.","<em>Everyone has a unique smell, except for identical twins. </em>Newborns are able to recognize the smell of their mothers and many of us can pinpoint the smell of our significant others and those we are close to. Part of that smell is determined by genetics, but it’s also largely do to environment, diet and personal hygiene products that create a unique chemistry for each person.","<em>The ashes of a cremated person average about 9 pounds. </em>A big part of what gives the human body weight is the water trapped in our cells. Once cremated, that water and a majority of our tissues are destroyed, leaving little behind.","<em>Nails and hair do not continue to grow after we die.</em> They do appear longer when we die, however, as the skin dehydrates and pulls back from the nail beds and scalp.","<em>By the age of 60, most people will have lost about half their taste buds. </em>Perhaps you shouldn’t trust your grandma’s cooking as much as you do. Older individuals tend to lose their ability to taste, and many find that they need much more intense flavoring in order to be able to fully appreciate a dish.","<em>Your eyes are always the same size from birth but your nose and ears never stop growing. </em>When babies look up at you with those big eyes, they’re the same size that they’ll be carrying around in their bodies for the rest of their lives. Their ears and nose, however, will grow throughout their lives and research has shown that growth peaks in seven year cycles.","<em>By 60 years of age, 60-percent of men and 40-percent of women will snore.</em> If you’ve ever been kept awake by a snoring loved one you know the sound can be deafening. Normal snores average around 60 decibels, the noise level of normal speech, intense snores can reach more than 80 decibels, the approximate level caused by a jackhammer breaking up concrete.","<em>A baby’s head is one-quarter of it’s total length, but by age 25 will only be one-eighth of its total length.</em> As it turns out, our adorably oversized baby heads won’t change size as drastically as the rest of our body. The legs and torso will lengthen, but the head won’t get much longer.","<em>Monday is the day of the week when the risk of heart attack is greatest. </em>Yet another reason to loathe Mondays! A ten year study in Scotland found that 20% more people die of heart attacks on Mondays than any other day of the week. Researchers theorize that it’s a combination of too much fun over the weekend with the stress of going back to work that causes the increase.","<em>Humans can make do longer without food than sleep. </em>While you might feel better prepared to stay up all night partying than to give up eating, that feeling will be relatively short lived. Provided there is water, the average human could survive a month to two months without food depending on their body fat and other factors. Sleep deprived people, however, start experiencing radical personality and psychological changes after only a few sleepless days. The longest recorded time anyone has ever gone without sleep is 11 days, at the end of which the experimenter was , but stumbled over words, hallucinated and frequently forgot what he was doing.","<em>A simple, moderately severe sunburn damages the blood vessels extensively.</em> How extensively? Studies have shown that it can take four to fifteen months for them to return to their normal condition. Consider that the next time you’re feeling too lazy to apply sunscreen before heading outside.","<em>Over 90% of diseases are caused or complicated by stress. </em>That high stress job you have could be doing more than just wearing you down each day. It could also be increasing your chances of having a variety of serious medical conditions like depression, high blood pressure and heart disease.","<em>A human head remains conscious for about 15 to 20 seconds after it is been decapitated. </em>While it might be gross to think about, the blood in the head may be enough to keep someone alive and conscious for a few seconds after the head has been separated from the body, though reports as to the accuracy of this are widely varying.","<em>It takes 17 muscles to smile and 43 to frown. </em>Unless you’re trying to give your face a bit of a workout, smiling is a much easier option for most of us. Anyone who’s ever scowled, squinted or frowned for a long period of time knows how it tires out the face which doesn’t do a thing to improve your mood.","<em>Babies are born with 300 bones, but by adulthood the number is reduced to 206. </em>The reason for this is that many of the bones of children are composed of smaller component bones that are not yet fused like those in the skull. This makes it easier for the baby to pass through the birth canal. The bones harden and fuse as the children grow.","<em>We are about 1 cm taller in the morning than in the evening. </em>The cartilage between our bones gets compressed by standing, sitting and other daily activities as the day goes on, making us just a little shorter at the end of the day than at the beginning.","<em>The strongest muscle in the human body is the tongue. </em>While you may not be able to bench press much with your tongue, it is in fact the strongest muscle in your body in proportion to its size. If you think about it, every time you eat, swallow or talk you use your tongue, ensuring it gets quite a workout throughout the day.","<em>The hardest bone in the human body is the jawbone. </em>The next time someone suggests you take it on the chin, you might be well advised to take their advice as the jawbone is one of the most durable and hard to break bones in the body.","<em>You use 200 muscles to take one step. </em>Depending on how you divide up muscle groups, just to take a single step you use somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 muscles. That’s a lot of work for the muscles considering most of us take about 10,000 steps a day.","<em>The tooth is the only part of the human body that can’t repair itself. </em>If you’ve ever chipped a tooth you know just how sadly true this one is. The outer layer of the tooth is enamel which is not a living tissue. Since it’s not alive, it can’t repair itself, leaving your dentist to do the work instead.","<em>It takes twice as long to lose new muscle if you stop working out than it did to gain it. </em>Lazy people out there shouldn’t use this as motivation to not work out, however. It’s relatively easy to build new muscle tissue and get your muscles in shape, so if anything, this fact should be motivation to get off the couch and get moving.","<em>Bone is stronger than some steel. </em>This doesn’t mean your bones can’t break of course, as they are much less dense than steel. Bone has been found to have a tensile strength of 20,000 psi while steel is much higher at 70,000 psi. Steel is much heavier than bone, however, and pound for pound bone is the stronger material.","<em>The feet account for one quarter of all the human body’s bones</em>. You may not give your feet much thought but they are home to more bones than any other part of your body. How many? Of the two hundred or so bones in the body, the feet contain a whopping 52 of them.","<em>About 32 million bacteria call every inch of your skin home. </em>Germaphobes don’t need to worry however, as a majority of these are entirely harmless and some are even helpful in maintaining a healthy body.","<em>Humans shed and regrow outer skin cells about every 27 days. </em>Skin protects your delicate internal organs from the elements and as such, dries and flakes off completely about once a month so that it can maintain its strength. Chances are that last month’s skin is still hanging around your house in the form of the dust on your bookshelf or under the couch.","<em>Three hundred million cells die in the human body every minute. </em>While that sounds like a lot, it’s really just a small fraction of the cells that are in the human body.  have placed the total number of cells in the body at 10-50 trillion so you can afford to lose a few hundred million without a hitch.","<em>Humans shed about 600,000 particles of skin every hour. </em>You may not think much about losing skin if yours isn’t dry or flaky or peeling from a sunburn, but your skin is constantly renewing itself and shedding dead cells.","<em>Every day an adult body produces 300 billion new cells. </em>Your body not only needs energy to keep your organs up and running but also to constantly repair and build new cells to form the building blocks of your body itself.","<em>Every tongue print is unique.</em> If you’re planning on committing a crime, don’t think you’ll get away with leaving a tongue print behind. Each tongue is different and yours could be unique enough to finger you as the culprit.","<em>Your body has enough iron in it to make a nail 3 inches long. </em>Anyone who has ever tasted blood knows that it has a slightly metallic taste. This is due to the high levels of iron in the blood. If you were to take all of this iron out of the body, you’d have enough to make a small nail and very severe","<em>The most common blood type in the world is Type O. </em>Blood banks find it valuable as it can be given to those with both type A and B blood. The rarest blood type, A-H or Bombay blood due to the location of its discovery, has been found in less than hundred people since it was discovered.","<em>Human lips have a reddish color because of the great concentration of tiny capillaries just below the skin.</em> The blood in these capillaries is normally highly oxygenated and therefore quite red. This explains why the lips appear pale when a person is anemic or has lost a great deal of blood. It also explains why the lips turn blue in very cold weather. Cold causes the capillaries to constrict, and the blood loses oxygen and changes to a darker color.","<em>The colder the room you sleep in, the better the chances are that you’ll have a bad dream. </em>It isn’t entirely clear to scientists why this is the case, but if you are opposed to having nightmares you might want to keep yourself a little toastier at night.","<em>Tears and mucus contain an enzyme (lysozyme) that breaks down the cell wall of many bacteria. </em>This is to your advantage, as the mucus that lines your nose and throat, as well as the tears that wet your eyes are helping to prevent bacteria from infecting those areas and making you sick.","<em>Your body gives off enough heat in 30 minutes to bring half a gallon of water to a boil. </em>If you’ve seen the Matrix you are aware of the energy potentially generated by the human body. Our bodies expend a large amount of calories keeping us at a steady 98.6 degrees, enough to boil water or even cook pasta.","<em>Your ears secrete more earwax when you are afraid than when you aren’t. </em>The chemicals and hormones released when you are afraid could be having unseen effects on your body in the form of earwax. Studies have suggested that fear causes the ears to produce more of the sticky substance, though the reasons are not yet clear.","<em>It is not possible to tickle yourself. </em>Even the most ticklish among us do not have the ability to tickle ourselves. The reason behind this is that your brain predicts the tickle from information it already has, like how your fingers are moving. Because it knows and can feel where the tickle is coming from, your brain doesn’t respond in the same way as it would if someone else was doing the tickling.","<em>The width of your armspan stretched out is the length of your whole body. </em>While not exact down to the last millimeter, your armspan is a pretty good estimator of your height.","<em>Humans are the only animals to produce emotional tears. </em>In the animal world, humans are the biggest crybabies, being the only animals who cry because they’ve had a bad day, lost a loved one, or just don’t feel good.","<em>Right-handed people live, on average, nine years longer than left-handed people do. </em>This doesn’t have a genetic basis, but is largely due to the fact that a majority of the machines and tools we use on a daily basis are designed for those who are right handed, making them somewhat dangerous for lefties to use and resulting in thousands of accidents and deaths each year.","<em>Women burn fat more slowly than men, by a rate of about 50 calories a day. </em>Most men have a much easier time burning fat than women. Women, because of their reproductive role, generally require a higher basic body fat proportion than men, and as a result their bodies don’t get rid of excess fat at the same rate as men.","<em>Koalas and primates are the only animals with unique fingerprints. </em>Humans, apes and koalas are unique in the animal kingdom due to the tiny prints on the fingers of their hands. Studies on primates have suggested that even cloned individuals have unique .","<em>The indentation in the middle of the area between the nose and the upper lip has a name.</em> It is called the philtrum. Scientists have yet to figure out what purpose this indentation serves, though the ancient Greeks thought it to be one of the most erogenous places on the body."];

var Sleep = ["The record for the longest period without sleep is 18 days, 21 hours, 40 minutes during a rocking chair marathon. The record holder reported hallucinations, paranoia, blurred vision, slurred speech and memory and concentration lapses.","It's impossible to tell if someone is really awake without close medical supervision. People can take cat naps with their eyes open without even being aware of it.","Anything less than five minutes to fall asleep at night means you're sleep deprived. The ideal is between 10 and 15 minutes, meaning you're still tired enough to sleep deeply, but not so exhausted you feel sleepy by day.","A new baby typically results in 400-750 hours lost sleep for parents in the first year","One of the best predictors of insomnia later in life is the development of bad habits from having sleep disturbed by young children.","The continuous brain recordings that led to the discovery of REM (rapid eye-movement) sleep were not done until 1953, partly because the scientists involved were concerned about wasting paper.","REM sleep occurs in bursts totalling about 2 hours a night, usually beginning about 90 minutes after falling asleep.","Dreams, once thought to occur only during REM sleep, also occur (but to a lesser extent) in non-REM sleep phases. It's possible there may not be a single moment of our sleep when we are actually dreamless.","REM dreams are characterised by bizarre plots, but non-REM dreams are repetitive and thought-like, with little imagery obsessively returning to a suspicion you left your mobile phone somewhere, for example.","Certain types of eye movements during REM sleep correspond to specific movements in dreams, suggesting at least part of the dreaming process is analagous to watching a film","No-one knows for sure if other species dream but some do have sleep cycles similar to humans.","Elephants sleep standing up during non-REM sleep, but lie down for REM sleep.","Some scientists believe we dream to fix experiences in long-term memory, that is, we dream about things worth remembering. Others reckon we dream about things worth forgetting to eliminate overlapping memories that would otherwise clog up our brains.","Dreams may not serve any purpose at all but be merely a meaningless byproduct of two evolutionary adaptations sleep and consciousness.","REM sleep may help developing brains mature. Premature babies have 75 per cent REM sleep, 10 per cent more than full-term bubs. Similarly, a newborn kitten puppy rat or hampster experiences only REM sleep, while a newborn guinea pig (which is much more developed at birth) has almost no REM sleep at all.","Scientists have not been able to explain a 1998 study showing a bright light shone on the backs of human knees can reset the brain's sleep-wake clock.","British Ministry of Defence researchers have been able to reset soldiers' body clocks so they can go without sleep for up to 36 hrs. Tiny optical fibres embedded in special spectacles project a ring of bright white light (with a spectrum identical to a sunrise) around the edge of soldiers' retinas, fooling them into thinking they have just woken up. The system was first used on US pilots during the bombing of Kosovo.","Seventeen hours of sustained wakefulness leads to a decrease in performance equivalent to a blood alcohol-level of 0.05%.","The 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska, the Challenger space shuttle disaster and the Chernobyl nuclear accident have all been attributed to human errors in which sleep-deprivation played a role.","The NRMA estimates fatigue is involved in one in 6 fatal road accidents.","Exposure to noise at night can suppress immune function even if the sleeper doesn�t wake. Unfamiliar noise, and noise during the first and last two hours of sleep, has the greatest disruptive effect on the sleep cycle.","The 'natural alarm clock' which enables some people to wake up more or less when they want to is caused by a burst of the stress hormone adrenocorticotropin. Researchers say this reflects an unconscious anticipation of the stress of waking up.","Some sleeping tablets, such as barbiturates suppress REM sleep, which can be harmful over a long period.","In insomnia following bereavement, sleeping pills can disrupt grieving.","Tiny luminous rays from a digital alarm clock can be enough to disrupt the sleep cycle even if you do not fully wake. The light turns off a 'neural switch' in the brain, causing levels of a key sleep chemical to decline within minutes.","To drop off we must cool off; body temperature and the brain's sleep-wake cycle are closely linked. That's why hot summer nights can cause a restless sleep. The blood flow mechanism that transfers core body heat to the skin works best between 18 and 30 degrees. But later in life, the comfort zone shrinks to between 23 and 25 degrees one reason why older people have more sleep disorders.","A night on the grog will help you get to sleep but it will be a light slumber and you won't dream much.","After five nights of partial sleep deprivation, three drinks will have the same effect on your body as six would when you've slept enough.","Humans sleep on average around three hours less than other primates like chimps, rhesus monkeys, squirrel monkeys and baboons, all of whom sleep for 10 hours.","Ducks at risk of attack by predators are able to balance the need for sleep and survival, keeping one half of the brain awake while the other slips into sleep mode.","Ten per cent of snorers have sleep apnoea, a disorder which causes sufferers to stop breathing up to 300 times a night and significantly increases the risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke.","Snoring occurs only in non-REM sleep","Teenagers need as much sleep as small children (about 10 hrs) while those over 65 need the least of all (about six hours). For the average adult aged 25-55, eight hours is considered optimal","Some studies suggest women need up to an hour's extra sleep a night compared to men, and not getting it may be one reason women are much more susceptible to depression than men.","Feeling tired can feel normal after a short time. Those deliberately deprived of sleep for research initially noticed greatly the effects on their alertness, mood and physical performance, but the awareness dropped off after the first few days.","Diaries from the pre-electric-light-globe Victorian era show adults slept nine to 10 hours a night with periods of rest changing with the seasons in line with sunrise and sunsets.","Most of what we know about sleep we've learned in the past 25 years.","As a group, 18 to 24 year-olds deprived of sleep suffer more from impaired performance than older adults.","Experts say one of the most alluring sleep distractions is the 24-hour accessibility of the internet.","The extra-hour of sleep received when clocks are put back at the start of daylight in Canada has been found to coincide with a fall in the number of road accidents."];
